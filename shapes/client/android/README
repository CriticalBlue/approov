The Android Shapes demo app.

The containing "android" folder can be imported into Android Studio as an exisiting project. 

To build a runnable demo app you must be a registered Approov customer on the trial tier or higher.

To make the Android Shapes demo app functional you will need to drop an Approov aar into the "approov_library" folder. 
See the approov_library README for details.
At this point the app will run but will not recieve any successful tokens from the Aproov service. 
To obtain valid Approov tokens you will need to generate a signed APK (this can be done with Android Studio) and register
that apk with the Approov Android app registration executable, available from the Approov Admin Portal.
